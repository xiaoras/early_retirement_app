# streamlit_webapp_template

This is a template to be used with PyCharm and venv in order to create a streamlit webapp.

Instructions:

1. Make a new repository with the same content as this one, calling it with the name of your app.
2. Clone your new repository in PyCharm, so as to have it locally in your machine.
3. Mark "src" as the root directory of the project.
4. Add a new (local) Python interpreter.
5. Run "scripts/change_env.sh": this will create a new environment and install the requirements.
6. Run "src/main.py" to launch the app (the actual app is in "src/app.py").
